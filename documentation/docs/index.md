# Welcome to alt-swing

This documentation is for a Python implementation of the systems engineering trade study framework described in the Systems Engineering Body of Knowledge.  This framework applies to alternative analysis using the swing weight matrix.  

The corresponding IPython notebook can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/gm4/alt-swing).

This implementation follows the systems engineering trade study process outlined on the Systems Engineering Body of Knowledge - Decision Management page.  Please visit the [SEBoK Wiki](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Decision_Management) for a good description of the methodology used.
