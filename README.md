# alt-swing
Python implementation of the SE decision process described at http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Decision_Management

## Background
Assess a set of alternatives, scoring performance using swing weights, and display the results.
The assessment follows this process:
*  Define a set of objectives with an associated value function and importance value for each objective
*  Establish a set of alternatives with corresponding performance measures for each objective
*  Determine the swing weight for each objective, considering both the importance and 'swing' in system value for each alternative
*  Calculate the resulting system value for all alternatives using the value contributed to each objective
*  Display results of the analysis
